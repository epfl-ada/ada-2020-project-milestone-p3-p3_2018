# Regional Data Protection Regulation Impact on Personal Privacy Protection Concerns

## Abstract

Based on research by Jonathon W. Penney on the impact of online surveillance on regulatory “Chilling Effects”, our project also focuses on privacy and studies a new subject using the same methods.

Data protection regulation being based on regional law, our study will focus on Europe and the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation by the European Union. In order to better restrict our area of study to the one directly affected by GDPR, our study will focus on the German version of Wikipedia instead of the English one. Indeed, German-speaking countries are all located in central Europe, and are either members of the EEA or strongly affected by GDPR.

We will concentrate our efforts on determining whether the adoption of GDPR on April 14th 2016 has had a significant impact on the trend of the number of pageviews on privacy-related topics, by using the same technique as Penney to study an Interrupted Time Series. Our study will focus on articles linked to GDPR that people would most likely consult to inform themselves on the protection of their personal data online.

## Research Question

- Demonstrate a significant majority of de.wikipedia.org pageviews come from GDPR-affected countries (which we will define as EEA + CH + UK)
- Has the introduction of GDPR induced European users to inform themselves about how to protect their own privacy?

## Dataset

To find the data, we used the Wikipedia REST API (https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pageviews%20data), which provides access to Wikimedia content and data, including pageviews.

## Methods

We will use the same method as proposed by Penney’, i.e. a model-based study of an Interrupted Time Series, with the interruption date being May 2018. We will use the same set of privacy-sensitive pages, and one of the proposed control groups as a comparison basis.
