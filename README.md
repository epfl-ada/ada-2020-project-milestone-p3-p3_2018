# Regional Data Protection Regulation Impact on Chilling Effects Mitigation

## Abstract

Based on research by Jonathon W. Penney on the impact of online surveillance on regulatory “Chilling Effects”, our project aims to determine whether data protection regulations that have come into force in the years following the Snowden scandal is an effective measure to prevent such effects.

Data protection regulation being based on regional law, our study will focus on Europe and the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation by the European Union. In order to better restrict our area of study to the one directly affected by GDPR, our study will focus on the German version of Wikipedia instead of the English one. Indeed, German-speaking countries all are located in central Europe, and are either members of the EU or strongly affected by GDPR.

We will concentrate our efforts on determining whether the introduction of GDPR on May 25th 2018 has a significant impact on the trend of the number of pageviews on privacy-sensitive topics, by using the same technique as Penney to study an Interrupted Time Series, using the same privacy-sensitive Wikipedia pages his study proposes.

## Research Question

- Demonstrate a significant majority of de.wikipedia.org pageviews come from GDPR-affected countries (which we will define as EU + CH + LI + UK)
- To which extent did the introduction of GDPR allow a reduction of “chilling effects” relative to privacy-sensitive Wikipedia researches?

## Proposed Dataset

In order to demonstrate a significant majority of de.wikipedia.org pageviews come from GDPR-affected countries, we can easily use data from https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/de.wikipedia.org/

Unfortunately, at the time we write these line, Penney’s source, the website https://stats.grok.se/, is completely unavailable. As such, finding the same data as the initial author for de.wikipedia.org will be more of an issue. We found another source at https://pageviews.toolforge.org/, but it will not allow us to retrieve data before July 2015. As such, it will not possible to study the timeframe studied by Penney for the German version of Wikipedia.

## Methods

We will use the same method as proposed by Penney’, i.e. a model-based study of an Interrupted Time Series, with the interruption date being May 2018. We will use the same set of privacy-sensitive pages, and one of the proposed control groups as a comparison basis.
